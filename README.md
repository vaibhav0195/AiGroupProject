A python Minesweeper with interfaces for Reinforcement Learning.

This is a simple game I wrote for learning _Deep Reinforcement Learning_.

## How to Install

In order to install this package, you need to have at least

+   `numpy`
+   `pyqt`

installed. If you don't want to bother with details of packages installation,
you can use [Anaconda](https://anaconda.org/) as your Python distribution.

And then install the package by

__From PyPI (the latest stable version)__

```bash
pip install minesweeper
```

or

__From GitHub (the bleeding edge version)__

```bash
pip install git+git://github.com/duguyue100/minesweeper.git \
-r https://github.com/duguyue100/minesweeper/blob/master/requirements.txt
```

Once you installed, you can start the Mine Sweeper GUI by typing following
under terminal

```bash
ms-gui.py # yeah, with .py, otherwise Windows CMD may not be able to find it!
```
