# Running
This code is meant to be executed on the root folder of this repository, that is, where the file *csp.py* is contained.

```
>>> from minesweeper.msgame import MSGame
>>> from csp import solve_minesweeper_csp
>>> ms = MSGame(10, 10, 10)
>>> solve_minesweeper_csp(ms)
```

# Contributions
The Minesweeper game framework was modified from [duguyue100's Minesweeper](https://github.com/duguyue100/minesweeper). The code inside *csp.py* was entirely written by Jorge Gonz√°lez.
